Forest High

This template mainly analyzes terrain slopes, satellite image's pixels and landcover
data to detect green areas on map for close to real-world texturing distribution and
vegetation placement.

There will be high density trees, plants and rocks in flat areas plus another lower
density vegetation and rocks on higher slopes.

Distribution of elements will be done by high density, resolution & distance settings.
