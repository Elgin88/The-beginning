# MicroVerse-Ambiance

The MicroVerse Ambiance system makes it easy to add audio environments and simple music to your scenes using optional box, radius, spline, and spline area falloffs (if MicroVerse-Spine is installed). 

See the main MicroVerse module, required for this to run, for documentation.
